/* Description  :
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of students in his/her class
and then calculates and displays number of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and F’s for the entire class.

Each student is graded on the following categories:
• 10 programming Exercises (progEx)
• 1 Midterm (midTerm)
• 1 Final Exam (final)

For each student, use random number generator to generate scores for each category.
You need to make sure that the random number generator
returns value in the range 1-100 for each of the grade book categories.
So for each student you need to calculate their grade using the following formula:

numericGrade = (progEx Average *.70) + (midTerm *.15)+(final *.15)

The program needs to compute the letter grade equivalent according to the following chart:
numericGrade (range)   letterGrade
0–59                       F
60-69                        D
70-79                        C
80-89                        B
90-100                       A

Once letter grade has been computed, update the count for that letter grade. When the program finishes the loop, it should display the following information:
Number of students who received each letter grade:
10 A
14 B
6 C
4 D
4 F
